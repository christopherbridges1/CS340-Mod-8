# CS340-Mod-8

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Writing modular code that can be used for different aspects of a program saves time and makes your programming more efficient. Using code that is both modular and secure allows the code to be reused in future projects and is much easier to maintain.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I start with the largest problems first. I ensure all functions are working properly and without errors before completing cosmetic changes. Making functionality a priority ensures you deliver a working project on time before layouts and colors are considered.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists work to ensure programs operate as anticipated while keeping everything as secure as possible. The modern world is built on software and computer scientists ensure everything keeps working as expected. The type of work I completed for this assignment can help sorting and filtering information within a database using a dashboard.
